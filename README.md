# ATMega32U4-16U4_SavePower_Library
Save Power Library for Arduino boards, which are based on ATMega32U4/16U4 chips. This library is made to allow the user to tailor the power consumption to the applicationâ€™s requirements, in order to reduce power consumption and prolong battery life.

Author: Hamza Taous

Version: 1.0.0

Chips Supported:

- ATMega32U4
- ATMega16U4

Save Power Library is developed using ATMega32U4/16U4 Datasheet ([click here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/atmel-7766-8-bit-avr-atmega16u4-32u4_datasheet.pdf)). Also, it has been tested and verified successfully with Arduino IDE 1.8.8 release.

***Important Note:*** Try to not miss to read carefully the long description in SavePower.cpp file cause it's the key to understand everything and know how things work clearly. I'm sure that will make you so excited to know more about the world of microcontrollers.
